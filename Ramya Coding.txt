Problem Statement:

Let's say the HR team of a company has goodies set of size N each with a different price tag for each goodie. Now the HR team has to distribute the goodies among the M employees in the company such that one employee receives one goodie. Find out the goodies the HR team can distribute so that the difference between the low price goodie and the high price goodie selected is minimum.
